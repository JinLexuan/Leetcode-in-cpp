https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/length-of-last-word  
Given a string s consistingÂ of some words separated by some number of spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.  
A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.  

Example 1:  
Input: s = "Hello World"  
Output: 5  
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.

Example 2:  
Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "  
Output: 4  
Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.  

Example 3:  
Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"  
Output: 6  
Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.  

Constraints:  
1 <= s.length <= 10^4  
s consists of only English letters and spaces ' '.  
There will be at least one word in s.  


``` cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLastWord(string s) {
        int ans=0;
        for(int i=s.size()-1;i>=0;i--){
            if (s[i]==' ' && ans!=0) return ans;
            if (s[i]!=' ') ans++;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
